## LLM APIs

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are a way to [interact with a model using code]{.alert}
- They allow you to send a prompt to a model and get a response back
- In contrast with user interfaces, [APIs are made for computers]{.alert}
  - They connects computers or pieces of software to each other
- APIs can do a lot of things, but we mostly associated with [web APIs]{.alert}, which [allow computers to interact with websites or servers on the internet]{.alert}
- We can do the same with LLMs too!
- Instead of going to a website, we can [use an API straight from software]{.alert}
  - Here we will use VSCode and the [Roo Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline) to interact with many APIs

## Roo Code

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Roo Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline) is an extension for VSCode that serves as a [coding agent]{.alert}
- Imagine something like GitHub Copilot, but with a lot more functionality
- Roo Code comes with powerful tools that can: 
  - Read and write files in your project 
  - Execute commands in your VS Code terminal
  - Control a web browser (if the LLM allows you to)
- It can also interact with both local and remote APIs, including DeepSeek, OpenAI, Claude, etc
- Installation: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline>
- The code is available at <https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code>

## Setting up Roo Code

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- First, install the Roo Code extension in VSCode
- Open the extension (rocket icon 🚀) and let's configure our first LLM!
- Click on the gear (top right) and you will be taken to the settings
- You will see a series of options, let's see one by one
- ... but we need [API keys!]{.alert}
- In most cases, API credits are usually [cheaper]{.alert} than monthly subscriptions for the average user
- You can get them directly from the model's website, or from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
- The good thing is, OpenRouter has many free models available too!

## Adding API keys

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="40%"}
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) provides a uniform way to interact with many APIs
- And it is super easy to use: just sign up and get your API key
- Then, we are doing to select the models we will use in Roo Code settings
- For this example, we will use the free version of DeepSeek
- Feel free to test other free models (or paid ones) available in OpenRouter
- Go to <https://openrouter.ai/> and sign up for an account (it is free, no credit card or subscription needed)

## Adding API keys

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="40%"}
- Then, click on your picture and `Keys`
- Copy the key and paste it in the Roo Code settings
  - You will only see the key once, so make sure to save it somewhere safe!
- You can create as many keys as you want, and revoke them at any time
- In `Credit Limit`, you can put a limit on how much you want to spend
- Feel free to put $0.00 if you want to use only the free models
- More models here: <https://openrouter.ai/models>

## Adding API keys

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
- Now, let's go back to Roo Code settings and add the API key
- Just copy and paste the key in the `OpenRouter API Key` field
- [We are almost ready to go!]{.alert}
- The last step is to select the models we want to use
- Model choice depends on the task you have at hand, but a general model is a good start
- Note that here we are not running the models locally, but running them on (someone else's) server
  - So [while you gain speed, you lose privacy]{.alert}

## Using agents in Roo Code {background-color="#2d4563"}

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
- So far, we have seen how to use Roo Code to interact with APIs
- It already saves you a lot of time, as you [don't have to go to a website to get the information you need]{.alert}
- But what if you could [automate even more tasks?]{.alert}
- [That's where agents come in!]{.alert}
- Agents are like [chatbots that can act autonomously]{.alert}, including [running code, sending emails, and interacting with websites]{.alert}
- [This is the future of AI]{.alert}, and it is already here!
- For coders, one of the best uses of agents is to [let it write and run code for you]{.alert}
- It is the closest thing to "vibes programming" (😂) we have so far
:::

## Using agents in Roo Code

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
- Let's ask Roo Code to do the following:
  - Create a new folder called `document`
  - Create a new Quarto file called `api.qmd`
  - Write a few paragraphs about the importance of APIs
  - Save the file
  - Render the file and open it in VSCode
  - We could ask it to send it to GitHub, but we will do it manually just for the sake of it
- Prompt:
  - "`Create a new folder called document in my current folder. Create a new Quarto file called api.qmd. Write three paragraphs about the importance of APIs. Save the file. Render the file and open it in VSCode.`"
- And see the magic happen! 🪄

## Alternatives to Roo Code and DeepSeek

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Roo Code is not the only tool that allows you to interact with APIs
- Other popular choices are [Cline](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev) and [Continue](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue)
- They are all free to use, and you can choose the one that best fits your needs
  - Roo Code is actually a fork of Cline, but with more features
  - Continue is a new tool that is gaining popularity
- They perform similar tasks and have a similar interface, so feel free to try them all 😉

## Alternatives to Roo Code and DeepSeek

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- DeepSeek is not the only free model available in OpenRouter
- Two models that are worth mentioning are [Google Gemini](https://openrouter.ai/models?q=gemini%20free) and [Qwen](https://openrouter.ai/models?q=qwen%20free)
- Gemini offers free access to [all its models]{.alert}, including their "thinking" ones
- Now that you know how to use APIs, you can get an API key for free at <https://aistudio.google.com/> and use it in VS Code
- Qwen is a model specialised in coding, and it is great for writing code snippets
- An advantage that both have over DeepSeek is that they are [multimodal]{.alert}, meaning they can generate text, images, and code
- For instance, you can input a screenshot on Gemini and ask it to transcribe and a translate a text, or Qwen to recreate a table in Markdown

# Giving internet access to your editor 🌐 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Browser-use

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- We have seen how to use LLMs locally, how to interact with APIs, and how to create agents
- But what if you could [browse the internet straight from your code editor]{.alert}?
- [OpenAI's Operator](https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/) was released to much fanfare and it allows you to do just that
- But there is a free and open source alternative called [Browser-use](https://browser-use.com/)
- It is a Python library that uses LLM APIs to [interact with websites]{.alert}, [extract information]{.alert}, and [perform tasks]{.alert}
- You can use it to [scrape data from websites]{.alert}, [fill out forms]{.alert}, [send emails]{.alert}, and [much more]{.alert}

## Browser-use Web-ui

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- To make things more convenient, Browser-use comes with a [web interface](https://github.com/browser-use/web-ui) that allows you to [interact with websites visually]{.alert}
- In this case, [we will need a model with vision capabilities]{.alert}, such as Google Gemini or Anthropic's Claude
- Let's get an API from Google and test it in Browser-use!
- But first, we need to install the software
- You can find the instructions [here](https://github.com/browser-use/web-ui)

## Browser-use Web-ui
### `.env` file and running the server

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
- Here is an example of the `.env` file
- You just need to add your API key to the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` field and you are good to go!

```verbatim
OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://api.openai.com/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=

GOOGLE_API_KEY=XXXXXXXX

AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=

DEEPSEEK_ENDPOINT=https://api.deepseek.com
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=
```

- To run the server, just type the command below in the `web-ui` folder:
  - `python webui.py --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 7788`
  - If you need to install `dotenv`, you can do it by running `uv pip install python-dotenv`
  - Then run `.venv/bin/python webui.py --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 7788`
