# Time to build! 🧑🏻‍💻👩🏼‍💻 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Hands-on Practice: The Goal

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}

- **Objective:**
- In this practical session, you will simulate a real-world data science workflow by creating and orchestrating two distinct, specialised AI agents.

- **Process:**
- You will build a "Data Strategist" to create an analysis plan, and then a "Python Coder" to write the code for that plan, acting as the project manager between them.

- **Environment:**
- This entire workflow will run locally on your machine using Ollama.

- **Estimated Time:**
- 50-60 minutes.
:::

## Part 1: Building the "Data Strategist" Agent

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
Your first task is to create a high-level AI agent that plans a data analysis project.

- **Create a Project Directory:**
- Open your terminal, create a new directory, and navigate into it.

```sh
mkdir multi_agent_practice
cd multi_agent_practice
```

- **Choose a Base Model:**
- We'll use `gemma3:1b` for our planning agent. It's a capable and very lightweight model.
- Use `ollama pull` to download the model.
:::

## Part 1: The "Strategist" `Modelfile`

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}

- **Create the `Modelfile` for the Strategist:**
- Inside your directory, create `Modelfile.strategist`. Add the following content, which defines our agent's persona.

```yaml
# Use gemma3:1b as the base model
FROM gemma3:1b

# Set a higher temperature for more creative planning
PARAMETER temperature 0.8

# Define the system prompt for the Data Strategist
SYSTEM """
You are a Senior Data Strategist. Your expertise is in
designing clear, concise, and actionable data analysis
plans. You are brilliant at strategy but you DO NOT
write code.

When given a description of a dataset, you must provide a
step-by-step analysis plan in Markdown format. The plan must
include the following sections:
1.  **Project Goal:** A single sentence defining the
    primary objective.
2.  **Key Research Question:** One specific, answerable
    question.
3.  **Data Loading & Cleaning:** A short bulleted list of
    initial steps.
4.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** A bulleted list of
    at least three specific visualisations to create.
"""
```
:::

## Part 1: Create and Use the "Strategist"

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}

- **Create the Strategist Agent:**
- In your terminal, create the `strategist` model.
- Use the command `ollama create` with the `-f` flag to specify the `Modelfile.strategist`.

- **Run the Agent:**
- Now, run the agent and give it the prompt for your project plan.
- Use `ollama run strategist` to start the agent.

- **Prompt:** `I have a fictitious dataset named 'store_sales.csv' with the columns: 'date', 'product_category', 'units_sold', and 'revenue'.`

- [**Important:**]{.alert} The agent will output a plan. **Manually copy this entire plan**, create a new file named `project_plan.md`, and paste the content into it. Save the file and then type `/bye` to exit the agent.
:::

## Part 2: Building the "Python Coder" Agent

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
Now you'll build the second agent. Its only job is to write Python code.

- **Choose a Coder Base Model:**
- We'll use `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b`, a lightweight but capable model specialised for coding.
- Again, use `ollama pull` to download the model.

- **Create the `Modelfile` for the Coder:**
- In the same directory, create `Modelfile.coder` and add the following:

```yaml
# Use qwen2.5-coder:1.5b as the base model
FROM qwen2.5-coder:1.5b

# Use a low temperature for deterministic code
PARAMETER temperature 0.2

# Define the system prompt for the Python Coder
SYSTEM """
You are a junior Python developer. Your job is to write
clean, executable Python code based on a specific
instruction from a project plan.
- You MUST use the pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn
  libraries.
- You write ONLY Python code. Do not include any
  explanations or text outside of the code itself.
- Wrap the entire output in a single Markdown code
  block (```python).
- Assume the data is already loaded into a pandas
  DataFrame named 'df'.
"""
```
:::

## Part 2: Create the "Coder" Agent

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}

- **Create the Coder Agent:**
- In your terminal, create the `python_coder` model from its `Modelfile`.
- Use `ollama create` with the `-f` flag to specify the `Modelfile.coder`, just like you did for the strategist.

- *(Self-check:* Run `ollama list` to confirm both `strategist` and `python_coder` are available.)

- Now we have our two specialist agents ready for the integration step!
:::

## Part 3: Integrating the Agents

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
This is the integration step. You will act as the project manager, taking the plan from the `strategist` and giving a specific task to the `python_coder`.

- **Assign a Task to the Coder:**
- Open your `project_plan.md` file and look at the "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)" section. Choose one of the visualisation tasks (e.g., "Generate a bar chart of revenue by product category") and copy the text.

- **Run the Coder Agent:**
- In your terminal, run your `python_coder` agent.

- **Manually paste** the single EDA task you copied as a prompt for the `python_coder` and press Enter.
:::

## Part 3: Finalise the Project

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}

- **Finalise the Script:**
- The agent will output the Python code required. **Copy the Python code** generated by `python_coder`.
- Create a new file in your project directory named `analysis.py` and paste the code into this file.
- Ensure that the code is commented and ready for execution.
- Save the commented `analysis.py` file.
- [**Bonus:**]{.alert} If you want to test your code with actual data, you can download a sample dataset from: [https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm350-summer/blob/main/lectures/lecture-17/store_sales.csv](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm350-summer/blob/main/lectures/lecture-17/store_sales.csv)
:::

## Bonus: Vibe coding with GitHub Copilot/Roo Code

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 30px;"}
- If you have time, paste the [Quarto file of this lecture](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm350-summer/blob/main/lectures/lecture-17/17-ai-pratice.qmd) into GitHub Copilot or Roo Code to see if they could do all the steps above for you!
:::

## End of Practice Session

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px;"}

- [Congratulations!]{.alert} 🥳
- You can now delete the models you created to free up space:
- Type `ollama ls` to see the list of models, then use `ollama rm <model_name>` to remove them, e.g., `ollama rm strategist` and `ollama rm python_coder`.
- Many thanks for your hard work today! 🥳
