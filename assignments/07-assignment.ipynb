    "1.  **Setup and Verification:** Set up a single AWS EC2 instance, connect to it, and verify its configuration.\n",
    "2.  **Remote Analysis:** Perform a complete data analysis workflow by generating data locally, uploading it to your EC2 instance for processing, calculating summary statistics, creating a plot, and downloading the results.\n",
